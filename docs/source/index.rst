Welcome to allocator's documentation!
=====================================

**allocator** is a C++14 project for custom allocators which work on both 
64- and 32-bit platforms.
  
An allocator that is suitable for big allocations is currently available. 
Next there will be one for small allocations and a general purpose mix of 
the two algorithms.
